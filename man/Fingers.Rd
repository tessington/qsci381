\description{
Finger tap rates after drug administration
}
\format{
  A data frame with 12 observations on the following 4 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{Subject}}{Subject code (\code{I}, \code{II}, \code{III}, or \code{IV})}
        \item{\code{Drug}}{Drug administered (\code{Ca}=caffeine, \code{Pl}=placebo, or  \code{Th}=theobromine)}
    \item{\code{TapRate}}{Finger taps in a fixed time interval}
   }
}
\details{
Scientists Scott and Chen, published
research that compared the effects of caffeine with those of theobromine (a similar chemical
found in chocolate) and with those of a placebo. Their experiment used four human subjects, and
took place over several days. Each day each subject swallowed a tablet containing one of caffeine,
theobromine, or the placebo. Two hours later they were timed while tapping a finger in a specified
manner (that they had practiced earlier, to control for learning effects). The response is the number
of taps in a fixed time interval.

Renamed FranticFingers in second edition.
