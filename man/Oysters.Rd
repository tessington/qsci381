\description{
Comparing methods for measuring the size of oysters
}
\format{
  A data frame with 30 observations on the following 5 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{ID}}{ID number of each oyster}
    \item{\code{Weight}}{Weight (in grams)}
    \item{\code{Volume}}{Volume (in cubic centimeters)}
    \item{\code{ThreeD}}{Measurement from a 3D system (pixels)}
    \item{\code{TwoD}}{Measurement from a 2D cross-section (pixels)}
  }
}
\details{
In 2001 engineers at an R&D lab Agri-Tech, Inc, in Woodstock, Virginia, designed a 3-D system that they hoped would improve on the existing 2-D system for measuring the size of oysters. The 3-D system used computer scanning to estimate an oyster volume, whereas the old 2-D system estimated a cross-sectional area. Data shows the result of both systems, as well as the actual weight and volume of each oyster used in calibration.
