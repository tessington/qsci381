Can telling a joke affect whether or not a waiter in a coffee bar receives a tip from a customer?
A study investigated this question at a coffee bar at a famous resort on the west coast of France.
The waiter randomly assigned coffee-ordering customers to one of three groups: When receiving
the bill one group also received a card telling a joke, another group received a card containing an
advertisement for a local restaurant, and a third group received no card at all. He recorded whether or not
each customer left a tip.
